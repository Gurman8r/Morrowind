OAAB Grazelands
=================================
by Melchior Dahrk
Version 1.4.0


Description
=================================
Currently, OAAB Grazelands focuses on the Tower of Tel Vos and the Village of Vos along with the surrounding area and dungeons; covering a large part of the northern Grazelands region. In addition to being a visual overhaul, this mod adds many new quests, dialogue, and scripted events. This mod was built on months of research into what a logical expansion of Vos would consist of within the context of the original game as well as themes for new quests and dialogue. Many of the new quests focus on Telvanni characters, but there is plenty to do for other characters as well.

Future updates will expand the area covered by this mod to the rest of the Grazelands region. The mod also includes a patched version of Remiros' Groundcover mod which fixes a few placement issues (including around campfires) and puts the grass on the new landscape meshes added by this mod.


Features
=================================

Tons of other changes to the settlements to improve game consistency, improve detail, fix placement issues, and much more.


Requirements
=================================
MWSE - this is a "soft" requirement for the mod. MWSE is not required for this mod to function, but several things will work differently (not as smoothly) without it.
MCP - for vanilla engine users, this mod relies on the MCP feature which enables GetSpellEffects to detect enchantments. OpenMW supports this natively.


Installation
=================================
Archive is BAIN structured

For manual installation, copy files to the Morrowind Data Files folder

If you use Remiros' Groundcover, install the "01 Remiros Groundcover GL Patch" - activate BOTH plugins while generating distant land
If you use RandomPal's patch for Remiros' Groundcover and Trackless Grazelands, install the "01 Remiros Groundcover GL Patch for Trackless Grazelands" - activate the ESP along with RandomPal's while generating distant land

If you use Old Vos Tradepost, install the included ESP.


Compatibility
=================================
OpenMW does not support one-way collision so the PassWall enchantments may not work as intended. Players will need to disable collision temporarily to get through these. The animation for the Eerie Lantern quest does not work properly in OpenMW - but the quest will complete properly.

Only Remiros' Groundcover is supported.

This mod is a complete replacement of my Tower of Vos mod. They should not be used together.
