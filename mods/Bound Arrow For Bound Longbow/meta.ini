nexusDescription="[i]\"His magic was strong, his mastery of the College of Conjuration unparalleled. With but a gesture he produced a bow in his hand and an arrow in his quiver. With but a thought he had that arrow nocked and another in its place before his first shot even reached its mark.\"[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Adds a global script that automatically creates and equips a replenishing Bound Arrow whenever you summon a Bound Longbow. Once your Bound Longbow spell finishes all Bound Arrows in your inventory are removed. Bound Arrows have no weight or value, and use the same model as the Daedric Arrow. If you place a Bound Arrow in your inventory after your Bound Longbow spell has finished (it's possible to get them from enemies you killed), it will disappear.\n<br />This mod has three versions: Balanced, Unbalanced, and Overpowered.\n<br />\n<br />[center]\xfeff[b][u][size=2]BALANCED[/size][/u][/b][/center]In the Balanced version Bound Arrows deal the same damage as Chitin Arrows, which are the second-weakest arrows in the game at 1-2 damage. I've tested this value and am pleased with its effectiveness; anything fired from a Bound Longbow is still sufficiently dangerous. This version also requires you to have a Conjuration skill of 45 or more. If your Conjuration skill is too low no Bound Arrow is summoned.\n<br />[size=2]In vanilla Morrowind the highest possible starting Conjuration skill you can have is 45, so it is possible to have access to this mod's capabilities at the beginning.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=2][center]UNBALANCED[/center][/size][/u][/b]In the Unbalanced version, Bound Arrows deal 1-4 damage, same as Steel Arrows, which are mid-tier. Bound Arrows are summoned along with your Bound Longbow regardless of your ranking in Conjuration.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=2][b][u]OVERPOWERED[/u][/b][/size][/center]In the Overpowered version, Bound Arrows deal the same damage as Daedric Arrows, which are the most powerful arrows in the game at 10-15 damage. Bound Arrows are summoned along with your Bound Longbow regardless of your ranking in Conjuration.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=3][b]!! IMPORTANT !![/b][/size][/center]It took me a [i]long [/i]time to get this mod working, and only after I took a look at what other people did for similar mods. You need to do this the first time you play after installing the mod:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Cast your Bound Longbow spell and save the game.\n<br />[*]Load the game you just saved (be sure your spell is still active).\n<br />[/list]And voila, your Bound Arrow will be equipped and from now on the mod will work as intended. You won't need to worry about doing this ever again, it's only for when you first install the mod."
