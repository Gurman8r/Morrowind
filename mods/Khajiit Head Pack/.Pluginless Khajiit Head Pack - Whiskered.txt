.Pluginless Khajiit Head Pack.
.....<Whiskered Version>.....

=== Install ===
Extract the folders to your Morrowind/Data folder.


=== Description ===
Replaces the 8 base khajiit heads.

All the meshes are glow-mapped: khajiit eyes will shine in the darkness like a cat. 
All the meshes are animated.
The foreheads are smoothed, to remove weird triangular seams from vanilla. Some smaller seams may remain.


=== Usage/Permissions ===
The textures in this "base" batch were made over the vanilla textures. They may be freely distributed/edited. 
The meshes are slightly enhanced versions of vanilla. They may also be freely distributed/edited.



=== Other ===
If you want the rest of the stuff (individual NPCs, vampires, converted hair), it's available on MMH:
