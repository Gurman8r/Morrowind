nexusDescription="[size=4]Yeah, I know: there's already the old [url=https://firefly.calislahn.com/]FIreflies Invade Morrowind[/url], and the more modern [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50538]Glowbugs.\n<br />[/url]But, the first one eats your FPS like crazy since the fireflies are single creatures, while the second one doesn't work on OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />This mod uses glowbugs activators from TR_Data and spreads them around the BC and the AI. It works on both OpenMW and MGEXE, and since it's using the same models used by TR, it's also going to ensure a certain level of consistency for people using TR.\n<br />\n<br />The fireflies only appear at night, and the effect is quite subtle\xa0(as it should).\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />Hope you enjoy the mod, cheers![/size]"
