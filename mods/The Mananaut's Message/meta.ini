He has a message that he wants you to deliver for him. At the end of the quest, you'll get your very own royal mananaut outfit!\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bc949t088s2ust1/SmallConcept.png[/img]\xfeff[/size]\n<br />\n<br />For some background on this mod, I made the \"mananaut\" outfit last year based on an AI-generated image which inspired me. I then used Midjourney to generate textures for it, pieced together some model resources and modeled bits myself to come up with the outfit you'll find in this mod. But I could never decide what to do with the \"space mage\" outfit (as I called it). Then Modathon came around this year and I was asking people for suggestions on how to implement it. AFFA aka Douglas Goodall -- who was one of the original quest writers for Morrowind -- came around with this idea:\n<br />\n<br />[quote]\"Royal Imperial Mananaut Alberius comes from an outer realm on the authority of Koor-in-Ymne to capture/punish one Yagrum for waterstriding and refusing to wear the left glove that marks guests. His fine is decreed as seventy years, four sky children, or two pinches of subcreatia.\"[/quote]\n<br />I thought this sounded great, so I asked AFFA if he'd be willing to write the quest for the mod and he got the first draft done that same day! So this mod includes a quest from the same person who gave us many of the faction questlines in the original game. It has great, esoteric dialogue that you'd expect from an \"astronaut lawman\" in The Elder Scrolls.\n<br />\n<br />AFFA already released another mod for this year's Modathon which I also highly recommend you check out: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52751]Fargoth Says Hello[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />For the themes, this mod includes a quest (Adventure) and a game of chance you can play with Fyr. If you're having a lucky (Serendipity) day, you might get away with the shirt on your back!\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/14pkw1ayvb5pz8j/Footer.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[u][img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cij4zip9ydmjw1h/2023_Banner_Achievements.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/5BGKwO0.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/X2CmxTJ.png[/img]\xfeff[u][img]https://i.imgur.com/t50o3G7.png[/img][u][img]https://i.imgur.com/Ge6L1fc.png[/img][/u][img]https://i.imgur.com/s5HMUP2.png[/img][/u][img]https://i.imgur.com/kc8fXpP.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/BdoV4vP.png[/img][u][img]https://i.imgur.com/O9ME8RM.png[/img][/u][u][img]https://i.imgur.com/wh0uX5P.png[/img][/u]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/F3wylaY.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/wkevqqJ.png[/img]\xfeff[u][img]https://i.imgur.com/7hmKYiZ.png[/img][u][u][img]https://i.imgur.com/YVh3EyZ.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/XSnAX1H.png[/img][/u][/u][/u][img]https://i.imgur.com/rZVYHTW.png[/img]\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/uqjLh5i.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/68IkAP8.png[/img]\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/DMPeu0V.png[/img]\xfeff\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/aNsGQz1.png[/img]\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/3cu6ed7.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/EkSj4v5.png[/img][/u][img]https://i.imgur.com/hqHtX6D.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
