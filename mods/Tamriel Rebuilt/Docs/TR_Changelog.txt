Tamriel Rebuilt Changelog

===============================================
build 22.11 [November 23, 2022]
===============================================

General notes

    Release 22.11 is intended to be played with Tamriel_Data v9.0 or later.
    This is a major content release. Additional content has been added to TR_Mainland.
    TR_Preview is deprecated and no longer supported by Tamriel Rebuilt. For people upgrading from an earlier version of Tamriel Rebuilt, we have included a dummy file, containing no content, to overwrite the old TR_Preview. This was done to prevent errors that would appear upon loading older versions of the plugin. You can safely delete this file from your Data Files folder. If you still want to see in-development TR lands, refer to our Release Files instead.
    TR_Travels (including all variants thereof) is deprecated and no longer included with Tamriel Rebuilt. Separate travel NPCs have been added to Vvardenfell travel locations directly in the TR_Mainland plugin, instead (see below for details). For people upgrading from an earlier version of Tamriel Rebuilt, we have included dummy files, containing no content, to overwrite the old TR_Travels variants. This was done to prevent errors that would appear upon loading older versions of the plugin. You can safely delete these files from your Data Files folder.
    We have included the new TR_Firemoth_Vanilla_Patch to solve a landmass conflict between the official Bethesda mod Siege at Firemoth and our expanded Morrowind mainland. If you intend to use Firemoth, load this patch after it.

TR_Mainland

    Added more than 300 cells of new exterior land as part of the Dominions of Dust expansion, containing almost all of the Roth Roryn region, the whole of the Armun Ashlands, and the southern half of the Velothi Mountains.
    Added Andothren, one of the biggest Dunmer ports on the Inner Sea and a major center of Hlaalu power.
    Added three smaller Hlaalu settlements: the mining towns of Omaynis and Menaan in the Roth Roryn, and the caravanserai of Arvud in the Armun Ashlands.
    Added TR’s first Redoran settlements: the quarry town of Bodrum in the Roth Roryn, and the hamlet of Uman in a Velothi Mountains valley.
    Added Mazkun, a hidden village of the Malahk Orcs high in the Velothi Mountains.
    Added roughly 120 new quests in Andothren and the badlands to its west, including TR’s first House Hlaalu and Morag Tong questlines, two Tribunal Temple questlines, the Mages and Fighters guilds, and Imperial Legion.
    Added the joinable Orkluh vampire clan in the Roth Roryn.
    Added two Ashlander clans – the Obainat in the Roth Roryn and the Ishanuran in the Armun Ashlands – both with functioning miscellaneous and Nerevarine quests.
    Added the Volenfaryon stronghold in the Armun Ashlands with several attached quests.
    Added the Monastery of St. Felms in the Roth Roryn region with an attached Temple questline.
    Updated (completely remade) exteriors across the Western seaboard of Telvannis, turning the area into the new, desolate Dagon Urul region (as part of the Embers of Empire expansion).
    Updated (completely remade) Firewatch – the district capital of Telvannis and the second-biggest Imperial city in Morrowind – and all of its interiors.
    Updated (completely remade) Helnim and all of its interiors. Now, this is a town run by the Zafirbel Bay Company, a rival of the East Empire Company, which enjoys fruitful trade relations with a mad Telvanni lord.
    Updated (significantly overhauled) the island of Althoa (previously known as Balvvarden) with snowy textures, a revamped Bahrammu, the new navy fort/village of Nivalis, and the stronghold-turned-Telvanni-tower of Andvaryon. All interiors were either overhauled or made anew.
    Updated (significantly overhauled) other small islands in the Sea of Ghosts, such as Urlis Rock.
    Changed Bal Oyra into a small Dunmer shack village, thereby constraining Imperial presence in Telvannis. Most old Imperial content from Bal Oyra was transferred to Nivalis or Firewatch.
    Updated (overhauled, completely remade, or added anew) more than 80 quests in Firewatch, Helnim, Bal Oyra, and Althoa, including two questlines each for the Imperial Legion, Imperial Cult, Fighters Guild, and Thieves Guild, as well as ones for the East Empire Company and Mages Guild.
    Added the quests “Drinking, Stealing, Ranting” to Roa Dyr.
    Added the quest “Brother Against Brother” to Almas Thirr.
    Updated nearly all of the Aanthirin region to remove over-use of rocks, make better use of landscape, and perform better.
    Added more roads to Aanthirin in order to bring it up to vanilla parity.
    Updated the Aanthirin region to use unique road textures and more unique plants.
    Updated Roa Dyr with merged meshes, significantly improving performance in the area.
    Added interiors to the previously interiorless Daedric ruins of Hadrumnibibi and Alumawia.
    Updated Manrizache, the underwater dwemer ruin near Bal Oyra to make it more logical, including adding a nearby underwater volcano that was the reason it fell below water.
    Added enemies to several old caves that were lacking them in previous releases of the mod.
    Added tons of newly made creatures across the mod.
    Added several new armor sets and tons of new weapons across the mods.
    Added a purchasable pack guar companion to Old Ebonheart stables.
    Added new summoning spells with special handling when MWSE-Lua is installed. Whereas in OpenMW or the unmodified vanilla engine these will appear as slighly modified vanilla summoning spells, to MWSE-Lua users they will summon new Daedra added by Tamriel_Data. Once this is possible in OpenMW, we will add that functionality there, too.
    Added new travel NPCs to Vvardenfell locations (deprecating TR_Travels) for better compatibility with mods that edits vanilla travel NPCs. These new NPCs are:
        Anedhil (TR_m0_Anedhil) in Sadrith Mora
        Domiah (TR_m0_Domiah) in Ebonheart
        Gindrala Nethri (TR_m0_Gindrala Nethri) at Vivec Docks
        Ohmonir (TR_m0_Ohmonir) in Vivec Mages Guild
        Sentius Veros (TR_m0_Sentius_Veros) in Seyda Neen
        Ysmund (TR_m0_Ysmund) in Dagon Fel
    Replaced several previously broken or stylistically ill-fitting assets across the mod with improved versions, most notably the Dunmer middle-class furniture set.
    Widened the Inner Sea north of Firewatch to allow ships to pass more easily.
    Replaced all of the old unnamed roamers in Telvannis with named bandits.
    Replaced the old Telvanni Library, which was highly inconsistent with Bethesda’s lore for House Telvanni, with a new Velothi tower.
    Renamed the Molagreahd region to Sunad Mora and reduced its size on account of the creation of Dagon Urul.
    Renamed the dreaded Helnim Fields region to Molag Ruhn.
    Removed Cephorad Keep to further limit the Imperial presence in what is ostensibly among the most isolationist and Empire-hostile parts of Morrowind. Interiors worth saving and all related quests were transferred to Old Ebonheart and Helnim.
    Removed a number of the hugely overused rock arches from earlier areas of TR, adjusting the landscape to account for it. The same was done for our old large cliff pieces.
    Removed an awful performance-hog of a tree grove from east of Necrom.
    Removed innumerable old and low-quality unique items/weapons/containers.
    Fixed hundreds upon hundreds of quest, dialogue, item placement, asset quality, and inconsistency bugs.

TR_Factions

    Added further progression tweaks to several factions to account for mainland quest content.
    Added Nerevarine quests to the Obainat and Ishanuran ashlanders in the new Dominions of Dust expansion.
    Added changes to faction reactions for factions added by TR_Mainland (although advertised, they had, in fact, always been missing).

TR_Firemoth_Vanilla_Patch

    Added the patch to resolve a conflict between Siege at Firemoth and TR_Mainland landmass.
