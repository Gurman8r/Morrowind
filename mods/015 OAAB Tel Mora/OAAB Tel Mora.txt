 OAAB Tel Mora
=============================
by Melchior Dahrk
Version 4.0.3


=============================
 What is OAAB?
=============================

OAAB stands for "Of Ash and Blight" and is my personal project to expand TES3:Morrowind into how I envision it. OAAB is heavily inspired by the original Concept Art and early developer texts about the game. It aims to make Vvardenfell a more dangerous and "dunmeri" place. There are two primary focuses of the project: 1) gameplay expanding the effect of ash and blight weather and disease and 2) expanding on the Dunmer culture, economy, and lore in a way respectful to the original game (including its inconsistencies?).


=============================
Features
=============================

OAAB Tel Mora enhances the city of Tel Mora by adding new buildings, new quests, detailing the landscape, and more. It accomplishes all this while staying lore friendly and without (in my opinion) going over the top by making the city too big.

Adds 5 new miscellaneous quests
Puts more rocks around the city to make it feel like it's in a vale
Adds a hanging gardens-style alchemical farm which is used as the primary economic engine for the city
Gives Lette a backstory (she works at the gardens). She returns to work there after being cured
Adds an alternate way to cure Lette
Fixes pathgridding (allows the guard to reach the beach area where Lette is at - they would get stuck in vanilla; and adds some railings to prevent NPCs from falling into the water as much)
Adds some bridges to help connect the city more
Adds two new buildings to the city
Craft and apply custom enchantments to new resin staves at the Staff Enchanter
Adds an extensive underground area to explore
Makes the guards in Tel Mora female (optional - for compatibility)
Take a job to acquire more types of plants for Dratha's gardens
Fixed dialogue filter for Lette so her greeting will update if you cure her even when you are not a Temple member
Get blasted into Oblivion if you anger Mistress Dratha
Adds a previously hidden rumor in the game to the inhabitants of Tel Mora
Adds a new quest based on that rumor to bring some healers to Tel Mora
Adds 2 new miscellaneous quests to the new healer NPCs who now offer healing services as well
Removes the infinite Hlaalu bonemold shields which were sold by the Tel Mora smith (she sells Telvanni shields now)
Replaced Radras' forge with a Telvanni version
Adds a bedroom for Dratha so she doesn't have to bunk with the rest of her underlings

New in 4.0.0
Adds 3 more miscellaneous quests to complete the Tel Mora story arc.
Gives NPCs who were missing beds places to sleep.
More defined walkways across the gardens and around the tower.
More exterior decoration.
Berwen's shop gets cleaned up after the Corprus Stalker is killed.
Lots of bugfixes and dialogue improvements

 Playing the Plugin
=============================

The contents of this mod are mostly restricted to the settlement of Tel Mora. Several miscellaneous quests have been added which can be started in various ways. This section includes some mild spoilers, so if you would prefer to encounter the new misc quests naturally, skip this section and start back up at "Recommended Mods".

(Vanilla) Cure Lette - this quest is a requisite for a couple others
After curing Lette, talk to people in town about "Latest Rumors" to start one new quest which leads to 2 others.
You can also talk to Lette's partner, "Liela" after curing her for another series of jobs.
The smith, Radras, also has a short quest inspired by a note found in the vanilla game.

For more quest information, refer to the SPOILERS txt file or discover them for yourself!
