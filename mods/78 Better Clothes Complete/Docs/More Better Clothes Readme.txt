    ABOUT THE PLUGIN


This mod changes several of the shirts in vanilla Morrowind, specifically the shirts that were not included in Better Clothes, to be smooth instead of segmented. It is meant to be used in addition to Better Clothes, and for Argonians, the tailoring kit from Better Clothes will work on the new shirts too.

Item IDs from vanilla Morrowind changed by this mod:

     Save Games


There shouldn't be any issues with save games using this, since it doesn't alter any dialogue, NPCs, or specific references in-game. Always clean your save with Wrye Mash when installing new mods.

      Bugs, Incompatibilities, and Other Issues


This mod must be loaded AFTER Better Clothes, or the Argonian shirt scripts won't work. it is safe to merge this mod with Better Clothes as long as you make sure the changes from this mod override the changes in Better Clothes.

Any other mods that make changes to the same clothes this mod changes will conflict. To use both at the same time, you will need to generate a Merged Objects .esp using TESTool or SmartMerger.

      Credits & Usage

PsychoDog Studios - Better Bodies and Better Clothes, both of which were used in the creation of this
Bethesda Softworks - original clothes and textures

Special thanks to Hrnchamd for the screenshots!

You may use any parts of this mod in your own mods for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, as long as credit is given to me for the resource. You do not need to ask first. You may include this mod in any "mod packs" that you construct for download, as long as your readme includes the name of this mod (More Better Clothes) and my username (Plangkye). You may not use these resources for any other game, because some of Bethesda's original models and textures for Morrowind were used.

I can be contacted on deviantArt and the official Bethesda Softworks forums under the username Plangkye if you have any other questions.
