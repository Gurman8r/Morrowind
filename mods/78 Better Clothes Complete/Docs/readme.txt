Darknut's Better Clothes Textures Version 1

By Darknut 4-1-09

***********************************************************************************

Calislahn gave me permission to edit the Better Clothes textures....

So here they are Tweaked to My liking ... use them if you want

***********************************************************************************

In this release I just did the Textures that were included in the Betterclothes 1.1 release ... as it stands there are still quite a few clothes in the game this mod doesn't effect.

I'm looking into doing the rest of them if the Betterclothes team gives the OK to mess with the meshes.

Installation:

Just unzip the files into the MW Directory.



This Mod overwrites the Betterclothes 1.1 textures
