This is a readme solely for the Tamriel_Data filepatcher.

The filepatcher consists of a .jar and a .txt file. Both are necessary if you need to patch other files.

If you have mods or savegames that rely on one of the old asset ESMs (TR_Data.esm, PC_Data.esm, or Sky_Data.esm), you will need to run the patcher over your mods and savegames! It will update your dependencies to point to Tamriel_Data.esm as well as the new asset names.

First, make sure you have a JRE ("Java Runtime Engine") installed. If you don’t have one, the patcher will behave as if it was an archive (Windows will try to unpack it), when it’s actually an exectuable file. Go to your search engine of choice and find a link to a JRE for your system.

When you are absolutely sure that the patcher is running correctly, run the TR_FilePatcher.jar by choosing one or more savegames or mods to patch. Make sure to save backup copies!

The filepatcher will run through the translations.txt and replace one reference with another. That's all it does. It can replace references within scripts (but not compiled scripts, you need to recompile), levelled lists, inventory, cell placements, etc.

If you are updating save games that were saved while using Tamriel Rebuilt build 16.09 or earlier, they will contain different region and city names, along with reference changes that the patcher can't solve. Make sure to clean your save afterwards with Wrye Mash or Enchanted Editor, as you normally would.
