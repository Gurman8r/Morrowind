===========
Description
===========
Makes equipped weapons no longer disappear when lowered. Instead they will shown on the character's hip or back. This new functionality affects both the player and all other characters, and works with all weapons from all mods. Additionally features a comprehensive set of high quality quiver and scabbard assets.

============
Requirements
============

MWSE Version:
    You must have MWSE's dependencies installed: https://mwse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
    You must have MWSE 2.1-dev or later, available at: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip

OpenMW Version:
    You must have the latest nightly build of OpenMW, available at: https://forum.openmw.org/viewtopic.php?t=1808

============
Installation
============

MWSE Version:
    Make sure you're on the latest nightly build of MWSE.
    Place the contents of the mod archive into your "/Morrowind/Data Files/" directory.

OpenMW Version:
    Make sure you're on the latest nightly build of OpenMW.
    Place the contents of the mod archive into your "/Morrowind/Data Files/" directory.
    Add the following to your settings.cfg file:
        ﻿﻿[Game]
        weapon sheathing = true
        use additional anim sources = true

If you find that the included sheath art clashes with your installed replacers you can simply delete the problematic "_sh.nif" files.

============
Modder Notes
============
If you want to add custom sheath visuals to your own weapons this mod makes the process both easy and efficient. No additional scripting needed. You simply need to place the mesh containing your custom visuals into the same directory as your weapon mesh, and give it a matching filename with an added "_sh" suffix.

Example:
    meshes/w/w_saber.nif     # the original base mesh
    meshes/w/w_saber_sh.nif  # the sheathed version


The contents of your "_sh" file should follow the conventions of those included in this archive. "Weapon" parts (those that should be removed when drawn) should be placed under a NiNode named "Bip01 Weapon", and "Sheath" parts (those that should always be visible) should be placed under a NiNode named "Bip01 Sheath". If your mesh is a quiver then you should also create a "Bip01 Ammo" NiNode with additional nodes inside (which will be used for attaching ammunition).

Example:
    |-Scene Root
    |
    |---Bip01 Sheath
    |  |
    |  |---TriShape(s)
    |
    |---Bip01 Weapon
    |  |
    |  |---TriShape(s)

There are around 70 "_sh" meshes included in the archive, be sure to check them out for more detailed examples.

Note that all of this is optional! If you choose not to, the mod will still display the weapon's base mesh while sheathed.
