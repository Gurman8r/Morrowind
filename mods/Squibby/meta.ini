I was considering giving her Daedra status so normal weapons can't effect her, but I can't imagine anyone attacking her....right???*\n<br />[/i][b][i]\n<br />[center]*Cleanup and other much-needed help by Juidius!*[/center]\n<br />[/i][/b]\n<br />[center][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52367?tab=files/][img]https://i.ibb.co/dkXVySV/Skooma-Moonsugar-bebe.png[/img][/url][/center]\n<br />[b]\n<br />[center][/center][/b]"
