Small Skyrim Crosshair (OpenMW compatible)
---------------------
A replacer by CibrHusK

This mod replaces your crosshair with one inspired by Skyrim.
There are more of those around but I felt another was required, this one is smaller and nonintrusive - but only if you follow installation instructions.

For Morrowind's old engine it includes a red 'target_ownership.dds' version, which is used in combination with Yacobi based ownership mods.
For OpenMW that file will be ignored unless you edited openmw_hud_box.skin.xml:    <Resource type="ResourceSkin" name="HUD_Crosshair_Owned" size="32 32" texture="textures\target.dds">

OpenMW Installation
------------
Copy the "Textures"-folder into your Morrowind "Data Files" folder
 Or order it properly with its vfs functionality (seen OpenMW for that)

Morrowind Installation & Usage
------------
Install Smart Crosshair* (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43191)
Copy the "Textures"-folder into your Morrowind "Data Files" folder
 Or order it properly using a mod organizer like Mod Organizer 2 (Recommended!) or Wrye Mash.
Disable the crosshair in your Morrowind Settings, otherwise Morrowind will put a upscaled version over the one added by Smart Crosshair.

* Untested with other ownership mods, I know it works with some UI mods, for Ownership Indicator you'll have to do manual editing as it's not compatible by default.
