-= Simple Camping 1.2.0 =-

You can find the camping items in most major cities and towns, look out for a outfitter or trader, they will most likely be selling the camping items.

The items are:
- Bedroll
- Campfire
- Kindling
- Travel Table

You need kindling to light a fire. A fire will not go out after it has been lit unless you put it out or move it.
If you sleep in a bedroll that is next to a lit campfire, you will receive a 1-minute fatigue buff.
It is illegal to camp in the cites.

-= Known Issues and Conflicts =-

This mod should not conflict with anything, as it only adds items and does not change anything.

One issue is the bedroll or campfire may float on some sloped terrain. Unfortunately this is a vanilla issue, but some mods(such as Just Drop It!) may fix it.
