nexusDescription="[center][size=3]Here we are! This is the culmination of my work on the settlements of Morrowind. [/size]\n<br />[size=3]My\xa0[/size][b][size=3]love letter[/size][/b][size=3]\xa0to this old and beautiful game. To its [/size][b][size=3]alien [/size][/b][size=3]and [/size][b][size=3]magic [/size][/b][size=3]atmosphere that still manages to draw me in, 20 years after its release.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Hours upon hours of work at my desk, with Aphex Twin in the background and my girlfriend telling me I should stop spending my time tweaking the position of a barrel\xa0or a crate while running around as an half naked dark elf with a bun.[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center]EXPLANATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW TO MY TOWN OVERHAULS[/center][/size][/b]\n<br />[size=3]This is a comprehensive overhaul project focused on town and cities, inspired by an appreciation for [b]Morrowind's original worldbuilding design and Michael Kirkbride[/b]'s concept art.\n<br />\n<br />Rather than forcing something new into the game, the goal was to [b]enhance vanilla[/b], adding details and restoring some elements seen in concept art but never implemented by Bethesda.\n<br />\n<br />A big effort has also been made to keep the [b]FPS cost as low as possible[/b], and\xa0the archive has [b]over 90 compatibility patches[/b], as one of the goals of this project was to be [b]highly compatible[/b] with other mods.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b][center][size=5]List of edited locations\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/center][/b]Here's a list of locations that are already covered by Beautiful Cities of Morrowind. The idea is that you shouldn't install any scenic/aesthetic overhaul or enhancement for these locations as Beautiful Cities already covers them. This includes both [b]interiors [/b]and [b]exteriors[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b]West Gash[/b]: Balmora, Gnisis, Khuul, Caldera, Ald Velothi\n<br />[b]Bitter Coast[/b]: Seyda Neen, Hla Oad, Gnaar Mok\n<br />[b]Ashlands[/b]: Ald'ruhn, Maar Gan, Molag Mar\n<br />[b]Ascadian Isles[/b]: Vivec, Suran, Ebonheart, Pelagiad\n<br />[b]Azuras Coast[/b]: Sadrith Mora and the Wolverine Hall, Tel Aruhn, Tel Fyr\n<br />\n<br />[b]Other locations already covered:[/b]\n<br />Ashlander Camps\n<br />Imperial Forts\n<br />Holamayan Monastery\n<br />Mount Assarnibibi\n<br />Seven Shrines\n<br />Dren and Arvel plantations\n<br />\n<br />Some locations were not edited for compatibility with a few mods that complement this project and that are recommended: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49075]OAAB Grazelands[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46177]OAAB Tel Mora[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49603]Nordic Dagon Fel[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48136]Concept art palace[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50181][size=3]Library of Vivec Enhanced[/size][/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50763][size=3]The magic rock of Maar Gan[/size][/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51419][size=3]Tales from the Ashlands - The Great Hive Baan Binif[/size][/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52840]Caldera Mine Expanded[/url],\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49353/]Immersive Mournhold[/url].\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5]Why use this instead of standalone mods - what's new here?[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][size=4][u]Beautiful Cities is more than a simple merge of mods[/u][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />The mod page used to have a list of merged mods since the mod initially started as a merge of standalone mods. However, over time, the project has evolved into something quite different from what you would get by simply using all the credited mods together. The mods and their respective authors are credited in the credits section, but the mod list no longer representative of what this project has to offer..\n<br />\n<br /> The general principles that guided me throughout\xa0the long updating history of this project were:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Less is more. No unnecessary additions, excessive clutter, or \"creative ideas\" that result in weird cobbling.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Coherence and consistency: when introducing a new asset, it should be naturally integrated throughout the entire game. Similarly, the style and density of clutter should remain consistent from one location to another.\xa0\x41n issue with installing different mods, created by different authors, for various towns is that it can result in a lack of a unified artistic direction.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />Practically\xa0speaking, this is what's been done:\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]In many cases, the mods I used as a foundation have undergone significant reworking to ensure that their quality is up to standards.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]The polishing process has been ongoing for over a year and has involved more than just fixing minor bugs and issues. As I gained more knowledge about Morrowind and collaborated with the TR team, my skills as a modder improved.\n<br />[/size]Some of the core issues present in the mods merged into this project were related to design rather than a lack of polish, and I am confident that I have addressed those as well.[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]Assets and FPS optimization[/b]: don't underestimate this point. To give you an example, the original HOTV (used as a base for Gnisis) had over 1200 refs in the main cell. The version included here has a bit more than 800, plus optimized and atlased versions of the new assets, resulting in a 15 FPS gain when compared with the original, standalone mod.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]TR_data and OAAB_data integration[/b] for an overall more organic experience when using Tamriel Rebuilt and the OAAB mod series. Using OAAB and TR_Data also means that assets are going to be consistent and coherent for each location while most standalone overhaul mods make use of different resources.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b][/b]There is a [b]significant amount of new content [/b]included in this mod that is not available as standalone mods. I have focused extensively on overhauling interiors, such as revamping every common/imperial shop using the expanded set provided by TR_data and OAAB_data, or the\xa0integrating the dunmer middle class set (covering more than 30 interiors).\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]The integration of Animated Morrowind's content has been made more\xa0\x63onsistent and logical. Some of the mods included in this project had their own animated NPCs, which I did not want to force into the core esp. For this reason, all the animated NPCs have been moved to the Animated Morrowind patches.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]Compatibility: the patch zip contains [b]over 90 compatibility patches,[/b]\xa0making this a surprisingly compatible project, considering its scale and scope. Some additional patches are also available [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52726]here[/url]\xfeff and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51194]here[/url].\xfeff\n<br />[/list][/size][b][size=5]\n<br />\n<br />[center]\xfeffINSTALLATION[/center][/size][/b][size=4]The mod uses a [u]fomod installer[/u] with instructions about requirements and how the various patches should be used.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=5][center]REQUIREMENTS[/center][/size][/b][center][size=4]OAAB_data\n<br />Tamriel_Data[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][center]MOLX USER FILE[/center][/b]For those who don't know about it, Mlox is a simple software that can sort your load order automatically. Mlox is a soft requirement for this mod as there's a lot of things that can break if your load order is not correct.\n<br />\n<br />Make sure to download the [b]latest version[/b], update by rfuzzo:\xa0\n<br />[/size][url=https://github.com/rfuzzo/mlox/releases][size=5]https://github.com/rfuzzo/mlox/releases[/size]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][center]CREDITS[/center][/b]Details about the credits are in the specific tab. \n<br />What I'd like to say here is that this project\xa0stands on the shoulders of many many members of the community who let me use their work or who helped me out when I needed help of feedback. I'm am grateful to all of you.[/size]"
