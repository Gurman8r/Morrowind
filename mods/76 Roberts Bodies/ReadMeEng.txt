Big thanks to the testers, raddimus and trancemaster_1988.

Requirements: Morrowind

This plugin replaces meshes of the bodies of the eight humanoid races and khajiits with more high-poly, based on Robert's male and female bodies for Oblivion. Mod uses the same bodypart system as Better Bodies. Unlike BB, plugin uses fully symmetrical skeleton.

Installation:
Copy "Data Files" folder to the root game directory, merge folders and enable Robert's bodies.esp in the morrowind launcher.

Conflicts:
This mod conflicts with any other replacer of bodies. It has small graphical conflict with Better Morrowind Armor&Better Clothes. Plugin will conflict with most of skimpy clothes for Better Bodies.

Permission:
All meshes, textures and esp-files from the mod can be used anywhere without asking, but don't forget about credits.
