Lower First Person Sneak Mode

Description:
In vanilla Morrowind, the camera offset when sneaking was so subtle that it was often difficult to tell when you were in sneak mode, especially when in sneak mode but detected so that the sneak indicator is off. This mod simply modifies the parameter that controls this camera offset so that it should be more clear when you are sneaking and feel more like Oblivion or Skyrim.

Installation: Add the .esp to Morrowind/Data Files and activate.
Shouldn't have any compatibility issues.
