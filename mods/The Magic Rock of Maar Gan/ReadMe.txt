II. Description

This mod changes the Maar gan shrine, reviewing the rock and adding a second floor where pilgrims can rest during their visits to the shrine.
The mod should make the shrine feel more structured and fleshed out.

The shrine comes in multiple versions from a more vanilla approach to a more unique one plus, an ashfall add-on.
See the screenshots of the different versions to have an idea of the different versions.

The mod folders come as follows:

  00 - Core Files
            Contains all the required files for the basic version. (RP favorite)

 01 - Alternate version
            An optional version that spice up the rock shrine (Vegetto Favorite)

 02 - Alternate version
﻿  An optional version that adds a Redoran Torii gate (we made it, was a pity to scrap)

03 - Ashfall add-on
﻿For all Ashfall users

04- Low-Res textures
﻿For all purists out here that play low-res

 05 - Patch for water removal
        You do not like the shimmering red water? You can use this patch, which will remove the water from the mesh.

III. Compatibility

It is not compatible with anything that changes the Maar gan shrine.
The mod is intended to be used on a new game.
