nexusDescription="[u]INTRODUCTION[/u]\n<br />I wasn't ever a big fan of how derpy and small Argonian heads look in vanilla. I think the gecko / newt design worked really well for females, but the males ended up not looking like how they sound and just never felt super nice to look at. I love the idea of dinosaur-esque lizardmen, so I altered the heads of the vanilla and TR argonian males to look more suited to my personal tastes.\n<br />\n<br />[u]DETAILS\n<br />[/u]- Males changed, Females left alone (now you can visually differentiate the genders)\n<br />- Each head is based off different dinosaurs\n<br />- TR Argonian heads Covered (Minor clipping issues on some hairs for some of the unique NPC TR heads but rest are all fine)\n<br />- Mesh replaces only, meaning retextures intended for vanilla will work well\n<br />\n<br />[u]EPILOGUE[/u]\n<br />This mod is a subjective piece that while as lore friendly as I think possible, some will disagree or perhaps not enjoy, which is okay. If you tried the mod, I hope you enjoyed, and if not, I hope it strengthened the reasons why you prefer the original game and it's designs."
