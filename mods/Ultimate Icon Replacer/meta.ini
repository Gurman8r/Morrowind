nexusDescription="Name: Ultimate Icon Replacer\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 2/9/2011\r\nCategory: Miscellaneous\r\nAuthor: Alaisiagae \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nReplaces all Morrowind object/inventory icons with better icons!\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nThis mod replaces all 600+ icons for all the stuff you can put in your inventory in Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon! The icons are remade to reduce the amount of empty space in the icon, and to increase item clarity. Also includes a download for people using Lurlock\\'s Left Gloves mod or my own Left Gloves Addon mod so that your leftified gloves/gauntlets/bracers/pauldrons can have new icons, too!\r\n\r\nOodles of thanks to Hrnchamd for rescuing this project! \r\n\r\n+ Pluginless replacer (please see \\\"incompatibility\\\" section for potential conflicts)\r\n\r\n- you can easily remove any icon you don\\'t like by deleting it.\r\n\r\n- there might be some extra icons in there (like the large kwama egg). Feel free to use it however you want (it won\\'t appear in-game unless you use an .esp. I also suggest renaming it!)\r\n\r\n- does not include some of the more obscure items not seen in-game, such as the ball-and-shackles and the Devourer artifact book. Check the screenies to see what is included in this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\r\n3. Copy files to (install folder)\\\\Morrowind\\\\Data Files\\\\\r\n4. Start Morrowind and play.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nDelete the stuff in your icon folder. Hint: look for icons last modified January 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\n1. Uninstall the old mod.\r\n2. Install the new mod.\r\n3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and should not corrupt any saves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nThis mod will conflict with all mods that modify the same icons. This includes pluginless replacers! If you don\\'t want to overwrite the icons from your pluginless replacers, then delete the ones from my mod. I highly suggest backing up all the icons added by mods in your Icons subfolders.\r\n\r\nIf you drag and drop my Icons folder into DataFiles, you will only be prompted to overwrite the subfolders - if you click \\\"yes\\\" then it will automatically overwrite not only the subfolder but all its contents, which means you might accidentally overwrite a mod\\'s pluginless icon replacement. TO AVOID THIS: extract my mod to a temporary location. Copy all icons in folder Icons\\\\a and paste into the Morrowind\\\\Data Files\\\\Icons\\\\a folder. If asked to overwrite, decide which icon(s) you want (mine or a mod\\'s) and click the appropriate option. Do this method with all the icons in my mod\\'s subfolders. Good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be any. If you find any problems, let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2011/2/8 - really actually fixed the Lefty files. If there are still problems, let me know.\r\n1.0, 2011/2/4 - fixed folder paths for the Lefty optional download. Sorry for any inconvenience!\r\n1.0, 2011/2/2 - Initial release.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on the official Elder Scrolls forums as \\'Alaisiagae\\'\r\nYou can find me on TESNexus as \\'Alaisiagae\\'\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Hrnchamd for rescuing my mod from failure! Without his help fixing the brightness and contrast for the icons, this mod would have been doomed, never to be released.\r\nThanks to the forum members (povuholo, Blouge, PeterBitt, Dae, iggey, KINGPIX, Frosty_theOzzie, nONatee.., and Enzo Dragon) who volunteered to test my mod and give me feedback. Many thanks for your help and advice!\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Morrowind.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to Planet Elder Scrolls for hosting so many magnificent mods.\r\nThanks to the folks on the Bethesda forums for their support and feedback. You guys/gals are great!\r\nThanks to Bluehair for creating the DDS Converter.\r\nThanks to the people who make Nifskope.\r\nThanks to the people who make Paint.NET\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nDDS Converter - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=8698\r\nNIFSkope - http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\r\nPaint.NET - http://www.paint.net/\r\nReadme Generator - http://lhammonds.game-host.org/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that you give me and Hrnchamd credit if you distribute any part of this mod."
