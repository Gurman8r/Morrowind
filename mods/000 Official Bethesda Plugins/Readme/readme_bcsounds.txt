Let the gentle chorus of swamp wildlife draw you further into the 
mire throughout the entire swampy region of the Bitter Coast. You'll
find dragonfly creatures now inhabit the muck ponds along the coast.

The areas in which the sounds are placed cover the extreme southwest
portions of the island of Vvardenfell. From the south, the placement 
starts directly west of Vivec and slopes diagonally northwest along 
the coast including the towns of Seyda Neen, Hla Oad, and Gnaar Mok.
