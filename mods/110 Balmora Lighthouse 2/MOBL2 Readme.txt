Description

The story...

	There lived a man in Balmora named Vincent Mugly on the east side of the river. He was a poor man and not very popular. So he left Balmora searching for a better life and was gone for many years. One day he came back with a huge amount of coins and built this house. At first it only had three floors which was more than enough for him and his new beautiful wife and newborn son. 
	When the boy was about eight years old his mother was murdered on her way to Caldera and he swore that one day he would revenge her. Vincent his father tried to persuade him from revenge because he did not want to loose his son also.
But when the boy was seventeen years old he got some unexpected news about his mothers killer and went looking for him but never came back. 
	As the years passed Vincent became sad and lonely and in desperation built the Lighthouse on top of his house to guide his son back home. He took in a lone adventurer to keep him company and help find his son. Every so often the adventurer would go on an expedition to search for the son and usually came back empty handed. After one such trip he returned to find the old man had passed away, ...but left him the house.

Download, extract and drag “MO Balmora Lighthouse 2.ESP” to Morrowind/Data Files folder. Drag "MAO" folder to Morrowind/Data Files/Meshes.

Installing for Morrowind Rebirth is the same. Only the ESP has another name "MO Balmora Lighthouse 2MR.ESP"

I only edited the landscape around the house and added two cells, no scripts.
Cleaned the mod with Wrye Mash. 

If you already have a house with too many items to carry and would like to move to Balmora Lighthouse then you can use the mod “Carry More or Less” http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/30831/? by Illiotibial to make it easier.
