The Astrologians are a small scale guild, with just a handful of guild members started by an Altmer named Nelangoth, who was previously part of the Mages Guild and still holds ties to them. Start the adventure at the top of Arkngthand where they uncover Dwemer secrets, run into remnants of failed Telvanni expeditions, and discover entirely new realms. Included are several new dungeons, expanded versions of Arkngthand and Galom Daeus Dwemer ruins, and new locations as the story progresses. \n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB[/url] is required, version 2.0.3 was used making this mod.\n<br />\n<br />No exterior landscape changes were made. Designed for maximum compatibility with other mods.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b]Recommended Mods:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50956]The Astrologer and the Night Sky\n<br />[/url]- Play a class that fits the part!\n<br />\xfeff\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384]Morrowind Optimization Patch\n<br />[/url]- For fixing the observatory collision.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51301]Astrology Shrines[/url]\n<br />- Intended to supplement this mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Benefits of OpenMW:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Some meshes make use of texture effects in OpenMW, and are given a gleam/shine when others cannot be done in vanilla. No extra steps are needed to see this.\n<br />\n<br />- High quality icons are included with this download which are only compatible for OpenMW. OpenMW allows use of higher resolution icon images which is taken advantage of. To use this, install the \xfeffOpenMWpatch afterwards and replace the original icons. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues/Bugs:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- For use with Spines of Madness, Winds of Change or any big Sheogorad region overhaul, load Astrologian's Guild esp after these mods. [u]This error will come up as: Unable to find \"Sealock Charter\".\n<br />\n<br />[/u][b]Fixed in the upcoming version:[/b][u]\n<br />\n<br />[/u]- The note in the Pundaab Sea Hut cannot be picked up in vanilla Morrowind (works in OpenMW only).\n<br />\n<br />- Killing Magiice can prevent Nova from following you when you're ready to go to the Sealock pylon. To fix this, after killing him use this console command:\n<br />[i]set AG_NovaQuest to 20[/i][u]\n<br />[/u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/htPWgF5.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/SNITkAX.png[/img]\xfeff[/center][center]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/MobNDdu.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/4cOKpUo.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/krJobRR.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/4swrfO9.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/EvzDnMl.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/MDKdI9B.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/852sZBq.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/MSgCq2Z.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/IKnrcv3.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/SQOjsSg.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
