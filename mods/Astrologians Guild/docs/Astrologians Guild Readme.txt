Astrologian's Guild
by Billyfighter


Description:
==================================================================================
Join a fully playable guild and gain ranks to the top. The Astrologians are a 
small scale guild, with just a handful of guild members started by an Altmer named 
Nelangoth, who was previously part of the Mages Guild and still holds ties to 
them. Start the adventure at the top of Arkngthand where they uncover Dwemer 
secrets, run into remnants of failed Telvanni expeditions, and discover entirely 
new realms. Included are several new dungeons, expanded versions of Arkngthand 
and Galom Daeus dwemer ruins, and new locations as the story progresses. 

OAAB is required, version 2.0.3 was used making this mod.

No exterior landscape changes were made. The following is a list of new exterior 
locations or locations with light edits:

Sealock Charter (0, 26) and (1, 26) 
New island, north of the map. No landscape edits, just OAAB land assets used.

Molag Amur Region (Arkngthand exterior) (0,-3)
Guild hall entrance 1

Molag Amur Region (Galom Daeus exterior) (8, 0)
Guild hall entrance 2

Bitter Coast Region (Derin Bolus exterior) (-6, 1)
New Dwemer ruins, nothing is here until you go through the story line.

Installing/Uninstalling:
==================================================================================
If not using a mod manager, place files directly into Data Files.

Files included:

- BookArt, Icons, Meshes, Sound, and Textures all contain files within a folder '
named "AG"
- Astrologians Guild.ESP

Instead of deleting the entire folders when uninstalling, make sure no other mods 
use the AG folders for assets.

If you're using OpenMW, there is an OpenMW icon folder, use these to overwrite 
the original icons for a higher quality icon pack.

Benefits of OpenMW:
==================================================================================
- Some meshes make use of texture effects in OpenMW, and are given a gleam/shine 
when others cannot be done in vanilla. No extra steps are needed to see this.

- High quality icons are included with this download which are only compatible for 
OpenMW. OpenMW allows use of higher resolution icon images which is taken 
advantage of. To use this, install the ï»¿OpenMWpatch afterwards and replace the 
original icons.

Notes by the Author:
==================================================================================
1.6: There may be one more large update in the future (assuming no immediate fixes 
are required) but as it stands it's a fairly complete project. 

Possible plans for the final release include:

- The Arkngthand and Galom Daeus side quests which involve the new guild members 
leading to a fully operational Observatory. Though I wouldn't just like it to 
move, I want to add some type of system to view and look at stars. This will take 
much planning and work.

- A conclusion to the Telvanni Hermit questline.

- A conclusion to the Lost Ruins discovery.

- Some new sets of armor exclusive to the mod.
