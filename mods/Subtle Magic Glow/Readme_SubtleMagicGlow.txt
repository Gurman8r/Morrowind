**********************************************************************

1. Requirements

Subtle Magic Glow requires only Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It does
not require either expansion, though will work with them installed.

**********************************************************************

2. What it Does

This mod is three sets of textures to replace the 'magic wrap' that
is put around enchanted clothes, armor, and weapons equipped by the
PC and dropped on the ground. The goal is to leave items identifiably
magical, yet not obscure the textures underneath the magic effect.

**********************************************************************

3. Installation

Choose which version you want to try. 'Faint' is the original moving
magic effect made more subtle and transparent. 'Fade' is a new texture
which does not shift and move except if the camera angle does, but
it slowly fades in and out. 'Static' is the same texture from fade,
only without the fade effect.

Back up the contents of your Data Files\Textures\magicitem directory,
if you have one.

Unpack the Subtle Magic Glow archive to a temporary directory. You
should see this readme file and three folders, one for each version.
Copy the Textures directory from the folder of the version you choose
into your Data Files folder. Windows will warn you that folders with
the same name already exist. Click Ok for windows to merge the new
folders with the ones already installed.

**********************************************************************

4. Uninstalling

To revert to the original textures used by a plain game install,
remove files CAUST00.DDS through CAUST31.DDS from 
Data Files\Textures\magicitem.

If you had another magic item shroud replacer installed prior to this,
replacing those same files with the ones from the other replacer will
restore the other mod.
