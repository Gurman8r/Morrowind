What's This?
============

The RealSignposts Plugin replaces the signposts in Morrowind by
signposts showing the real names of the locations.


What's New in 1.1?
==================

I basically made new textures. RealSignpost now uses the dds
format instead of tga textures, which makes it possible to
include mipmaps and makes the package much smaller.


Installation:
=============

1. Copy the content of this package to "Morrowind/Data Files".
2. Enable the plugin using the Morrowind Launcher.
3. Good Hunting!
