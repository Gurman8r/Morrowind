Mistify
by Melchior Dahrk

This mod enhances the ambiance of the Bitter Coast by adding a new mist effect throughout region which appears during the night and certain weather conditions. It will burn off in the morning sun. The effect has been optimized to minimize performance impact. Compatibility issues should be minimal due to the subtle nature of the mist.


Installation:

00 Core - Includes the plugin to make mist appear on the Bitter Coast
01 Vanilla Mist Replace - VANILLA MIST REPLACER
02 Scumpatibility - Install this if you use a texture replacer for the BC scum like Lougian's. This will prevent alpha flickering for the pools of scum. This will have a slight graphical impact (no green tinted water for instance) and won't work with the default texture from Lougian's texture replacer (the bubbles). It works best with something solid like lily pads in Lougian's alternate textures.
