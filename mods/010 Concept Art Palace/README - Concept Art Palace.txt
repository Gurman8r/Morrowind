Concept Art Palace (CAP)
	By NobuRed
		My attempt to bring Vivec's palace closer to Kirkbride's original concept art and make it truly worthy of a living god.

I. REQUIREMENTS

	-Tribunal
	-Bloodmoon
	-Morrowind Code Patch
	-Tamriel_Data
	-OAAB_Data


II. DESCRIPTION

	A sharp contrast from the basic vanilla dome (presumably for performance reasons and limited draw distance), the palace concept art depicts a blazing green fire surrounded by eight revolving planets (plus moons) constructed from bronze, glass and opal.

	Following this design as closely as possible, CAP includes the following folders:

		00 - Core Files
			Contains all the required meshes and textures, as well as the default (and recommended) CAP Dome plugin for a single majestic flame, and three addons that 	enhance the palace bridge with decorative lamp-fountains, the palace columns with glowing Daedric runes, and the entrance with a unique door and engraved doorstep. 

		01 - Dome - Small Fires
			CAP plugin for numerous flames around a more complex 3D glow effect. Less performance-friendly than the default version.

		02 - Dome - No Fire
			CAP plugin for only a flameless 3D glow model. Better performance than the default version.

		03 - Dome - Planets Only
			CAP plugin for no flames or glow whatsoever. No performance impact (for modern computers, anyway).
		
		04 - Doorstep - ESO
			CAP plug in that changes the palace doorstep with the ordinator hand from ESO

		05 - GitD - patch
			CAP plugin to add compatibility with Glow in the Dahrk

 
		
	Please view the screenshots to get a better idea on the different options and animations, keeping in mind that your particular mod list may result in a somewhat differing palace exterior (mostly when it comes to vanilla retextures and mods adding guards, candles and other decorations).

	
III. INSTALLATION & REMOVAL

	Manager: Mod Organizer 2 or Wrye Mash is highly recommended for easy installation, activation and removal.

	Manual: Extract contents of "00 - Core Files" folder to your Morrowind Data Files directory, overwrite if needed, then extract the contents of any desired patch folders, let those overwrite, and finally enable any desired plugins in the Morrowind Launcher. To remove this mod, simply deactivate its plugins.

	Dome and doorstep options can be exchanged and overwritten without issue.

	NOTE: Although this mod should not harm your game in any way, always create a backup just in case. I cannot be held responsible for how CAP may interact with your particular mod list and saved game. To repair a saved game, follow these steps: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind_Mod:Repairing_Saves


IV. COMPATIBILITY

	This should be compatible with anything that doesn't directly change Vivec's palace and bridge, making the following mods safe to use: Morrowind Rebirth, Dramatic Vivec, Versus Vivec and Illuminated Palace of Vivec.

	Note that Distant Land presently cannot render animated objects, making the dome's planets appear stationary and flameless from afar.


V. CREDITS & PERMISSIONS

	This mod would have never been possible without the Resdayn Revival Team. Everything you see in Concept Art Palace came from their Ghostgate Fortress assets. I simply tweaked their meshes to meet my needs and edited some alpha channels. All credit goes to them and their awesome work: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45822

	For the default CAP Dome plugin, the planet textures and holy fire were all made by the N'Wahs & Mushrooms Team: Koxae, zaebok_kun and Axemagister.
	The engravings add-on textures are made by me as well as the mesh, with the exception of part of the bridge fountain for which all credits go to the original author of dramatic Vivec LondonRook.

	Thanks to Zobator and MD to making the GitD patch possible.
	Thanks to Ravenorror and  Spacedevo for polishing the final product.
	Special Thanks to RandomPal for the support, the interiors, the testing, etc. etc.
	
	The flame texture for the 01 version is my modification of the blue fire from Bethesda's Tribunal expansion.

	The palace idea and concept art belong to Michael Kirkbride.

	Make sure to credit the Resdayn Revival Team and N'Wahs & Mushrooms Team if you wish to use or modify their planets or glow.

	I own nothing in this mod except the (substantial) time I invested. As such, I cannot forbid you to reuse it, but I would be grateful if you would let me know or involve me in your project.
