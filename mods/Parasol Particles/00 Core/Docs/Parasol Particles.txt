Parasol Particles
by Melchior Dahrk

This mod adds falling spores particle effects to the emperor parasol mushrooms. I have included LOD to help with performance (the particles will disable once they are outside of visible range). The mod also includes a optional replacers if you use PeterBitt's, SWG's, or the Telvanni Bump model replacers.


Installation

You only need to install one.

00 Core - replacer for vanilla parasols. Compatible with Epic Trees.
00 PeterBitt's Replacer - replacer for PeterBitt's parasols (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45350)
00 SWG's Replacer - replacer for SWG's parasols (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42595) - this also optimizes SWG's replacer for better performance
00 Telvanni Bump Maps Replacer - replacer for Telvanni Bump Maps (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42431)

If you use Ashfall, insteall the "Ashfall" folder instead of the other folder. You only need ONE 00 folder for this mod to work. Choose based on your desired replacer. Note that these patches only include the meshes, you will need to install the original replacer first to get the proper textures.

Patches

01 OAAB_Data Patch - makes the "mushroof" mesh from OAAB_Data drop spores.
