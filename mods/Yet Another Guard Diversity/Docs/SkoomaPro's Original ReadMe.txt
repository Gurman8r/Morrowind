Guard Diversity
by SkoomaPro


Description:
This mod replaces the generic, copy-pasted guards of Morrowind with different
variations. Some guards have different loadouts and armor, and each have different
faces.

Installation/Uninstallation:
To install, just put the .esp in /Data Files. No other files are required. To uninstall,
uncheck the .esp in the launcher and delete the .esp in /Data Files.


Saved Games:
This mod doesn't require a new save to work, but you may need to wait or switch cells to see
the change. Removal shouldn't cause a savegame corruption, but always make a new save just
in case.


Compatibility:
This mod doesn't alter how guards interact with the player, and shouldn't cause problems with
mods that add guards to the game. It may, however, affect mods that rely on modifications to
the stock guards or their references, which are no longer present in game. It uses vanilla
head options, and is compatible with Better Heads or similar head replacers. It is compatible
with mods that add or change the stock guards, but changes made by either my mod or another's
may not be noticable in some areas.

This mod does not require or affect either expansions (yet).

This mod have been cleaned with TESAME.


Legal:
I really don't care what you do with this, so long as you don't use it for commercial purposes.
I also take no responsibility for any damage caused to your game or saves, if you can even do
such a thing with such a small file.


Changelog:
v1 - release - replaces generic guards with random equivalents.

will now wear their helmets. Redoran and Hlaalu guards will now have a chance to have helmets.
Replaced the overlooked Hlaalu Sharpshooter with a random equivalent.

found, though in the minority.
