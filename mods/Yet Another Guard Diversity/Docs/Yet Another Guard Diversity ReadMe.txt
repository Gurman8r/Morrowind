============
Description
============
"This mod replaces the generic, copy-pasted guards of Morrowind with different variations. Some guards have different loadouts and armor, and each have different faces."
- SkoomaPro

SkoomaPro's (somewhat obscure) Guard Diversity mod was, hands down, one the best "guard diversity" mods that I have tried. However, there was room for a few minor improvements:
• I added a female-only "leveled list" to the guards in Tel Mora. The reason for this is that the people in Tel Mora say there are no men there, including the male Tel Mora guards...
• Imperial Guards in the game were labled just "Guard", while other guards such as Telvanni, Hlaalu, Redoran all are labled "Hlaalu Guard", "Telvanni Guard", etc. Imperial Guards will now show up as "Imperial Guard".
• I added matching pauldrons to the Telvanni Cephalopod Helm. Telvanni guards are now more distinct from Hlaalu and Redoran, in a subtle way.
• Finally, I added more overall variation and fixed many bugs (see changelog).

By using a variety of so-called "leveled lists", the composition of the guards changes from time to time.

Morrowind

Installation
=============
Before you install the mod it is important to consider which version you want to use:
• Yet Another Guard Diversity - Regular: gives Telvanni guards new pauldrons.
• Yet Another Guard Diversity - Purist: no new Telvanni pauldrons.
• Yet Another Guard Diversity - Full Cephalopod: gives Telvanni guards new full Cephalopod armor. This version can be expanded on by installing Telvanni Cephalopod Armor (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49103) on top (both mods are fully compatible).
• Yet Another Guard Diversity - Fully Modular: use this version when compatibility with other mods is concerned.

Copy the "Yet Another Guard Diversity.esp" file (and the Icons and Meshes folder) into your Morrowind\Data Files folder. Activate the mod in the Morrowind launcher.

Note: If you happen to use Antares' Big Mod, you should want to install the YAGD Antares Big Mod Compatibility Patch under Miscellaneous files. Make sure to load this patch after Antares' Big Mod in your load order.

Distribution permission
========================
You are not allowed to convert/alter/modify/translate/improve/commercial benefit/use assets from or reupload this mod to other sites under any circumstances, without getting my permission to do so first. If you are interested in using this mod (in part or in whole) in your own mod please contact me first. I'm pretty open about people using my stuff as a modder's resource for creating their own unique mods, but I would need to see if it is along my vision or even improves on it, before I can give permission.

Please do not compile and release my mods in a larger mod without permission. I am not a fan of people trowhing cheap rips of my mods of mine (with or without small adjustments) in mod packs or compilation mods. My mods are subject to updates and expansions on a mere whim, so I want to keep track of comments and see if users have bug reports or feedback for the mod in question. This won't be possible if people only knew my work through a sort of compilation.

Changelog
==========
Version 1.9 [December 19, 2020]
• Fixed two Telvanni guards not wearing their armor.
• Removed the "RR Mod Series - Better Telvanni Cephalopod Armor" version in favor of suggesting using the mashup by the N'wahs and Mushrooms Team, which is fully compatible with my "Full Cephalopod" version.
• Fixed a Patch for Purist fix that was reverted by YAGD.
• Removed some dirty cell edits.

Version 1.8 [April 28th, 2020]
• Fixed guard background topics. They should now show correctly.
• Fixed a guard that was missing a weapon.
• Guards in Gnisis were given proper Short Blade skills according to their level. They are now able to properly use their Imperial Shortsword.
• Increased Telvanni guards Medium Armor skill to 50. This does not only make sense gameplay wise but also prefent incompatability with other mods causing these guards to not equip their armor.
• Non-Imperial Imperial guards were given simpler equipment and lower ranks (inspired by vanilla Gnisis guards). This was done in favour of both variation and consistency with the base game.
• Removed a_cephalopod_helm.nif fix. This is covered by Morrowind Optimization Patch (which is highly recommended to use anyway) and takes away worries of overwriting files.

Version 1.7.1 [January 27, 2020]
• Small hotfix update fixing "SP_hlaalu guard out_07" which was unintentionally removed.

Version 1.7 [January 27, 2020]
• Included updated meshes by Wolli and CiceroTR.
• Tweaked heads for more variation.
• Tweaked some of the equipment to be more vanilla friendly and for better aesthetics with Weapon Sheathing.
• Removed dirty edits.
• Added a fully modular version for improved compatibility with other guard mods and complete city overhauls. This replaces the previous No Telvanni version.

Version 1.6 [February 24, 2019]
• Fixed the error message regarding talking to Danso Indules about "meet the archcanon" for real this time. Removed any possible conflict with regarding this part of the main quest (dialogue referred to vanilla guard IDs). Thank you marlowemcdougal for the comprehensive testing and your reports.

Version 1.5 [February 2, 2019]
• Fixed an error message regarding talking to Danso Indules about "meet the archcanon".

Version 1.4 [January 28, 2019]
• Added guard diversity to Ebonheart plaza.
• Fixed the guard background topics.
• Fixed interiors guards facing to the wall.
• Removed Imperial Silver armor from common guards because it felt kinda out of place. In the vanilla game, only the Duke's guard wear their silver armor. Aside from that, it's mostly worn by a random Dunmer (which is kinda weird).
• Fixed an abnormally large guard inside one of Maar Gan guard towers.
• Renamed "Hlaalu Sharpshooter Guard" to "Hlaalu Sharpshooter" (in line with the other archers).
• Fixed vanilla Imperial Archer background topic.

Version 1.3 [July 26, 2018]
• Lowered the Telvanni Cephalopod Pauldrons enchantment values considerably. They still have a high enchantment (Daedric values + 0.25% = in line with the existing Telvanni Cephalopod Helm) but are no longer overpowered.
• Instead of making individual patches for the many mods that change Telvanni guards, I decided to upload a version that does not change the Telvanni in any way whatsoever. This way the mod should be compatible with all those mods, including the lesser known.

Version 1.2 [July 26, 2018]
• Added matching pauldrons to the Telvanni Cephalopod Helm, so the Telvanni guards are now more distinct from the Hlaalu and Redoran guards.
• Fixed a small bug in one of the leveled item lists (Each=No -> Each=Yes).

Version 1.1 [July 25, 2018]
• Added an optional patch for Telvanni Cephalopod Armor by Danke & Cheydin.

Version 1.0 [July 25, 2018]
• Initial release.
