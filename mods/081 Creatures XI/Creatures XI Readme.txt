Creatures XI readme


This download includes ALL creatures content, it is not just an update. So if you use a texture replacer instead of the textures supplied, be aware not to overwrite your textures with the originals. (For example, if you are using Darknuts texture replacers)

Please also read Creatures X Readme.txt for previous info, and also Creatures X ini update.txt

To Install:
Extract the mod as normal, plx_crt folders should appear within Textures, Sounds, Meshes, Icons, etc.

There are 4 esps in this version, choose which version of Creatures you would like to use. There is also an esp that is to be loaded after merged objects, which MAY fix the spawning issues but also allow you to include Creatures in the merged objects process.

Creatures.esp - Full version. This includes every creature/NPC/ingredient to the game - i.e., the normal mod

Creatures (lore).esp - Lore Friendly version. This removes from the levelled lists all items that are not lore friendly

Creatures (Semi).esp - Semi-Lore friendly version. This keeps all the items that feel like they are lore friendly, although there is no lore for them.

Please note that all the creature IDs exist in each esp, only the levelled lists are different. You must only choose one to use. Also note that the Lore and Semi levelled lists might be a bit empty after removing entries, so in places I've populated with alternative entries. This won't give the same feel to the game, but stops some lists from being near empty


You should now be able to include Creatures in the merged objects process just fine, just run Creatures Merged Objects Fix.esp after the merged objects file. This esp contains just the scripts, ensuring no errors to the scripts from merging. I will be honest, this may or may not work. Not all players experienced the script spawning errors, and requires a lot of gameplay to fully check if this fixes the issue or not.
If in doubt, do as all previous versions of Creatures, and don't include it in Merged Objects, and don't activate this esp.


If you use either the  6th House mod or Great House Dagoth mod, then activate the relevant patch to make the new 6th house creatures friendly to you.


Fixes:
6th House weapon icons
Kriin Hide ingredient mesh
Dwemer Bolts on Centurion Archer
Missing mesh on exploding Centurion spiders

Adjustments:
Kriin Spawning reduced (roughly 10% less chance of spawning, and removed from some levelled lists)
Rat/Bug spawning in town reduced (roughly 40% reduction)
Rotworm Spawning (roughly 20% less chance of large swarms)
Spider Daedra Armour
6th House Weapon damage reduction
Reduce Ice Worm Spawning occurances
Wasp Swarm spawning (10% less chance of swarms)
Liches use levelled lists for equipment
Daedric Bats have larger hit boxes

Additions:
Cave Trolls
Horned Scrib
Flesh Atronach
Vissed
Geti
Raptor
Slara
Rhulrym
Treekin
Seducer
Flaming Skulls reintroduced


As usual, thanks to all the community for feedback, testing, and resources. This mod could not have been made without you all!
