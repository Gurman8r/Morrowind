Description
============
Has your character ever contracted Greenspore? Rattles maybe? Or Rockjoint? Rust Chancre?? Most likely not. Although the in-game descriptions of these diseases state that they can be contracted from various animals, these were never assign to any of them. This diseases exist in the Construction Set however, but Bethesda for some reason decided to cut them from the game. This mod restores diseases by assigning them to existing creatures and fixes some other (disease) inconsistencies, in accordance with in-game dialogue.

Restores diseases:
• Chills (Drain Intelligence, Agility & Willpower 30) may be contracted from Skeleton, Crippled Skeleton, Bonelord, Bonewalker and Greater Bonewalker.
• Dampworm (Drain Speed 30) may be contracted from Nix-Hound.
• Greenspore (Drain Personality 20) may be contracted from Small Slaughterfish.
• Rockjoint (Drain Agility 40) may be contracted from Diseased Alit and Guar. 
• Rattles (Drain Willpower & Agility 10) may be contracted from Nix-Hound.
• Rust Chancre (Drain Personality & Speed 10) may be contracted from Diseased Rat.
• Serpiginous Dementia (Drain Intelligence, Personality & Willpower 10) may be contracted from Betty Netch and Bull Netch.

Other fixed lore inconsistencies:
• Ataxia (Drain Strength & Agility 10) may be contracted from Slaughterfish.
• Brown Rot (Drain Strength & Personality 10) may be contracted from Skeleton, Crippled Skeleton, Bonelord and Greater Bonewalker.
• Droops (Drain Strength 30) may be contracted from Kwama Forager and Kwama warrior.
• Wither (Drain Strength & Endurance 10) may be contracted from Dreugh and Dreugh Warlord.

Permissions
============
You are not allowed to convert/alter/modify/translate/improve/commercial benefit/use assets from or reupload this mod to other sites under any circumstances, without getting my permission to do so first. If you are interested in using this mod (in part or in whole) in your own mod please contact me first. I'm pretty open about people using my stuff as a modder's resource for creating their own unique mods, but I would need to see if it is along my vision or even improves on it, before I can give permission.

Please do not compile and release my mods in a larger mod without permission. I am not a fan of people trowhing cheap rips of my mods of mine (with or without small adjustments) in mod packs or compilation mods. My mods are subject to updates and expansions on a mere whim, so I want to keep track of comments and see if users have bug reports or feedback for the mod in question. This won't be possible if people only knew my work through a sort of compilation.

Changelog
==========
1.6 [June 21th, 2019]
• Drastically lowered the chance to encounter a diseased Kwama Forager (from 25% to 5%). Droops is a pretty nasty disease (Drain Strength 30) for such a low level creature that is always hostile.
• Removed the function of catching Blight disease while out in a Blight storm. This was done in light of compatibility with other mods that add this function in their own way (e.g. Merlord's Frostwind). If you liked my implantation, you should download my Blight Storms Restored mod.

1.5 [May 18th, 2019]
• Remade the mod from scratch. Everything is now handled by script which should improve compatibility with other mods.
• Compensated the heavier diseases (-20 / -40 attributes) stat-wise in line with what Bethasda did (instead of completely canceling out the negative effects of diseases).
• "Diseased" creature variants now have the ability to randomly carry one of two diseases. This way I didn't have to assign new diseases to healthy creatures or edit Leveled Lists.
• In cases where this was not possible, I gave the "healthy" creature a 25% chance to carry a disease. This reduces the likeliness to contract a disease from a healthy creature variant, while still removing the lore-inconsistencies and keeping an element of surprise.
• Some already dead versions of creatures also have a 25% chance to carry a disease.

1.4 [September 19th, 2018]
• All adjusted creatures now have their right (vanilla) stats. This fixes an issue that caused rats to move very slowly.

1.3 [March 31th, 2018]
• Added the function of catching Blight disease while out in a Blight storm.

1.2 [October 17th, 2017]
• Added the missing Serpiginous Dementia disease to Betty Netch, Bull Netch, Giant Bull Netch.

1.1 [October 7th, 2017]
• In the first version, Dampworm (Drain Speed 30) was not assigned to a creature because I made Nix-Hound (to which it belongs according to in-game dialogue) already carry Rattles (Drain Willpower & Agility 10). Now I made a new Nix-Hound  carry Dampworm with a different ID (same name, same appearance) on the advice of 6thHouseBellHammer. I added this Dampworm carrying Nix-Hound to the Leveled Lists with level 3+ Nix-Hounds, to making it less common than the more forgiving Rattles disease.

1.0 [October 3th, 2017]
• Initial release.
