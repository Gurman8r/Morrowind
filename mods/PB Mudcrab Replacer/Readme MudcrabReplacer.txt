Description:
--------------------------
This is a mesh and texture replacer for the Mudcrab creature.
Comes with full PBR support for the MGE XE Physically Based Rendering Prototype.

The model and textures where made from scratch. 
Pherim rigged the model to the original skeleton to make it use the original animations.



Installation:
-------------------------
Copy the content of this archive in your Morrowind folder.



Physically Based Rendering:
--------------------------
MGE XE PBR Prototype: http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/26348/?

Quote Hrnchamd: "PBR is an advancement in lighting and texturing that allows your computer to render a greater variety of more complex and beautiful materials. The physics allows them to be consistently interesting in all lighting conditions."

This is still in development and not suggested for your regular playthrough. But it makes sense to have the model already using PBR features as the same implementation will propably be added to OpenMW too.



Changelog:
--------------------------
- fixed bounding box (thanks to Greatness7)
