Argonian Full Helms Beta

By u/Dagoth_Vulgtm


Adds three new argonian-tailored versions of existing helmets to the game, each with an option with or without horns.

The helms can be found in Seyda Neen, in a chest by the river below the entrance to the tradehouse.


Feel free to take these and mod them into the game in any way you desire.
