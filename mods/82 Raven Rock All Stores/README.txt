MOD START
Progress the Bloodmoon East Empire Quests until Carnius Magius or Falco Galenus asks you whether Raven Rock should have a smith or a trader. Choose "I wish to finance the construction of both" and pay 2000 Septims. Continue the quest as normal (which is to say wait for two days, then report to Carnius) and the trader's post and smithy will both appear in Raven Rock.
