nexusDescription="Adds 1200 NPCs to over 550 cells via leveled lists to bring Morrowind to life. All NPCs have random heads, hair, and equipment (so no two will look the same), and appear and disappear at random. This &#39;rotation&#39; simulates people travelling to and from towns, and going in and out of taverns, shops, guildhalls etc. The purpose of the mod is to alleviate the staticness of the Morrowind world, as well as adding colour, variety, and new challenges for players.\r<br />\r<br />This mod alters some of Morrowind&#39;s leveled lists, so you will need to use a leveled list merging tool if you want to use it with other mods that do the same. The best tool is Wrye Mash, available from [url=http://wryemusings.com/]http://wryemusings.com/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />If you are upgrading from an earlier version of MCA make sure you disable the old version first, and clean your saved game using Wrye Mash&#39;s repair function.\r<br />\r<br />CHANGES IN 8.2\r<br />\r<br />- The Ash Revenant will now animate correctly, instead of wandering around with its right arm outstretched like it&#39;s directing traffic.\r<br />- Fixed the animation bug with the skeletal corpses, where the right thigh would sometimes twist out of shape if they were wearing greaves.\r<br />- Moved an annoying spawnpoint in the Ald-Ruhn Mages Guild that would always block the hallway.\r<br />- Beggars no longer ForceGreet the player.\r<br />- Caravaners&#39; Pack Guars now spawn further away so they don&#39;t prevent you from activating the NPC.\r<br />- Male Archers no longer wear skirts.\r<br />- Added Legion Deserters.\r<br />- Created add ons for &#39;BadKarma&#39;s Clothing Vendor&#39; and &#39;Hilgya the Seamstress&#39;.\r<br />- Moved all add ons to a separate folder to (hopefully) stop people activating them automatically without the relevant mods installed, and wondering why they&#39;re getting error messages.\r<br />- It is now possible to re-run the MCA setup script if you want to alter your settings. Simply type &#39;set MCA_Loaded to 0&#39; into the console and save your game. When you reload, the setup script will run.\r<br />\r<br />CHANGES IN 8.1\r<br />\r<br />- Fixed the UV mapping on the quivers.\r<br />- Traveling Merchants and Peddlers now have the correct dialogue.\r<br />- Traveling Merchants now sell less armourer&#39;s hammers.\r<br />- Fixed an issue where friendly NPCs would sometimes follow the player between cells after fighting Bandits.\r<br />- Companions no longer yell their attack sounds when you make them sheath their weapons.\r<br />- Companions are now knocked unconscious when their health gets too low. This has NOT made them invulnerable, as they can still die if they take massive damage. It will just happen a lot less often.\r<br />- Re-enabled dialogue with MCA NPCs.\r<br />- Fixed some missing sounds for the zombie companion.\r<br />- Removed a reference to a non-existent sound file in the male Courtesan script.\r<br />- Scaled Pack Donkeys down to a more realistic size.\r<br />- Fixed a bug in the Clothiers of Vvardenfell add-on where peasant women would spawn wearing a short coat that exposed their lady bits.\r<br />\r<br />CHANGES IN 8.0\r<br />\r<br />- Tweaked all scripts to improve performance, and removed many unnecessary ones.\r<br />- MCA is no longer dependent on &#39;Westly&#39;s Master Head Pack&#39;, and uses only vanilla heads and hairs (aside from a few custom heads assigned to companions). Download a pluginless replacer if you want pretty heads again.\r<br />- Changed the way NPC parties spawn to improve performance.\r<br />- Removed Rangers and Bounty Hunters.\r<br />- Warriors and Archers no longer spawn with mismatched armour.\r<br />- Rogues no longer carry shields.\r<br />- Added some new tabards and helmets for the Knights to wear.\r<br />- Removed all Undead creatures. Download &#39;The Undead v4.0&#39; to bring them back.\r<br />- Created new icons for the Sixth House equipment.\r<br />- Fixed the Daedric Bat bug in the Tamriel Rebuilt add-on, and an issue where some NPCs in interiors wouldn&#39;t spawn when they were supposed to.\r<br />- Created add-ons for Westly&#39;s &#39;Khajiit Diversity Revamped&#39; and &#39;Fine Clothiers of Tamriel&#39;, Korana&#39;s &#39;Peasant Gowns Replacer&#39; and Illuminiel&#39;s &#39;Oh My Goddess&#39;.\r<br />- Numerous other tweaks and fixes.\r<br />\r<br />RECOMMENDED MODS\r<br />\r<br />It is highly recommended that you use the following mods alongside MCA to enhance your Morrowind experience:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://download.fliggerty.com/download-127-751]Westly Presents: Fine Clothiers of Tamriel[/url]\r<br />Adds some amazing new clothing, which the MCA NPCs will wear if you use the add-on.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42117]Ranked Dremora by Neoptolemus[/url]\r<br />Separates all Dremora into ranks like in Oblivion. All have unique meshes, using Miltiades&#39; Dremora race as a base, and has an option to add female Dremora as well.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42103]Ships of the Imperial Navy by Neoptolemus[/url]\r<br />Adds some cool looking galleons to various locations around Vvardenfell. Includes an add-on for Tamriel Rebuilt.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145/]Tamriel Rebuilt[/url]\r<br />I don&#39;t think I need to explain this one.\r<br /> \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43030]The Undead by Neoptolemus[/url]\r<br />Basically Morrowind Comes Alive for undead. This was formerly part of MCA, but has been moved to a fully compatible stand-alone mod.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/westlys-pluginless-head-replacer]Westly&#39;s Pluginless Head Replacer[/url]\r<br />Replaces all the ugly Bethesda heads.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42933]Wyrmhaven by Neoptolemus[/url]\r<br />Has absolutely nothing to do with MCA, but it&#39;s a cool island/quest mod that I made and you should totally play it."
