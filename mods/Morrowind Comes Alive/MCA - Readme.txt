Morrowind Comes Alive v8.2 by Neoptolemus - Tribunal and Bloodmoon required
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adds 1200 NPCs to over 550 cells via leveled lists to bring Morrowind to life. All
NPCs have random heads, hair, and equipment (so no two will look the same), and
appear and disappear at random. This 'rotation' simulates people travelling to and
from towns, and going in and out of taverns, shops, guildhalls etc. The purpose of 
the mod is to alleviate the staticness of the Morrowind world, as well as adding
colour, variety, and new challenges for players.

This mod alters some of Morrowind's leveled lists, so you will need to use a leveled
list merging tool if you want to use it with other mods that do the same. The best
tool is Wrye Mash, available from http://wryemusings.com/

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of MCA make sure you disable the old
version first, and clean your saved game using Wrye Mash's repair function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN 8.2

- The Ash Revenant will now animate correctly, instead of wandering around with its
  right arm outstretched like it's directing traffic.
- Fixed the animation bug with the skeletal corpses, where the right thigh would
  sometimes twist out of shape if they were wearing greaves.
- Moved an annoying spawnpoint in the Ald-Ruhn Mages Guild that would always block
  the hallway.
- Beggars no longer ForceGreet the player.
- Caravaners' Pack Guars now spawn further away so they don't prevent you from
  activating the NPC.
- Male Archers no longer wear skirts.
- Added Legion Deserters.
- Created add ons for 'BadKarma's Clothing Vendor' and 'Hilgya the Seamstress'.
- Moved all add ons to a separate folder to (hopefully) stop people activating them
  automatically without the relevant mods installed, and wondering why they're
  getting error messages.
- It is now possible to re-run the MCA setup script if you want to alter your
  settings. Simply type 'set MCA_Loaded to 0' into the console and save your game.
  When you reload, the setup script will run.

CHANGES IN 8.1

- Fixed the UV mapping on the quivers.
- Traveling Merchants and Peddlers now have the correct dialogue.
- Traveling Merchants now sell less armourer's hammers.
- Fixed an issue where friendly NPCs would sometimes follow the player between cells
  after fighting Bandits.
- Companions no longer yell their attack sounds when you ask them to sheath their
  weapons.
- Companions are now knocked unconscious when their health gets too low. This has
  NOT made them invulnerable, as they can still die if they take massive damage. It
  will just happen a lot less often.
- Re-enabled dialogue with MCA NPCs.
- Fixed some missing sounds for the zombie companion.
- Removed a reference to a non-existent sound file in the male Courtesan script.
- Scaled Pack Donkeys down to a more realistic size.
- Fixed a bug in the Clothiers of Vvardenfell add-on where peasant women would spawn
  wearing a short coat that exposed their lady bits.

CHANGES IN 8.0

- Tweaked all scripts to improve performance, and removed many unnecessary ones.
- MCA is no longer dependent on 'Westly's Master Head Pack', and uses only vanilla
  heads and hairs (aside from a few custom heads assigned to companions). Download a
  pluginless replacer if you want pretty heads again.
- Changed the way NPC parties spawn to improve performance.
- Removed Rangers and Bounty Hunters.
- Warriors and Archers no longer spawn with mismatched armour.
- Rogues no longer carry shields.
- Added some new tabards and helmets for the Knights to wear.
- Removed all Undead creatures. Download 'The Undead' to bring them back.
- Created new icons for the Sixth House equipment.
- Fixed the Daedric Bat bug in the Tamriel Rebuilt add-on, and an issue where some
  NPCs in interiors wouldn't spawn when they were supposed to.
- Created add-ons for Westly's 'Khajiit Diversity Revamped' and 'Fine Clothiers of
  Tamriel', Korana's 'Peasant Gowns Replacer' and Illuminiel's 'Oh My Goddess'.
- Numerous other tweaks and fixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING THE OPTIONAL ADD-ONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MCA - Vampire Realism Patch.esp

Use this esp if you use Jaxalot's Vampire Realism mod, and want the vampires added
by MCA to require staking like the VR ones. Do not activate it without 'Vampire
Realism' or it will crash your game.

MCA - COV Addon.esp

This esp is for use with the 'Clothiers of Vvardenfell' mod by Korana, BadKarma and
Lady Rae. With this enabled, some NPCs will now be wearing the clothing from COV.

MCA - TR Addon.esp

Adds MCA NPCs and creatures to the 'Tamriel Rebuilt' lands. Also adds some of the
new TR items to the MCA leveled lists. Requires 'Tamriel Rebuilt'.

MCA - Khajiit Diversity Revamped Addon.esp

This esp changes some of the MCA Khajiit NPCs into Dagi-Raht, Ohmes-Raht, Cathay-
Raht and Senche-Raht, where appropriate. Requires Westly's 'Khajiit Diversity
Revamped', and will work with any of the 4 esps.

MCA - Illy's OMG Addon.esp

Adds Illuminiel's amazing Imperial Cult robes to the MCA priests and priestesses.
Requires 'Illy's Oh my Goddess'.

MCA - BB Peasant Gowns Addon.esp

Adds Korana's peasant gowns for 'Better Bodies' to some of the MCA peasant women.
Requires either 'BB Peasant Gowns' OR 'Peasant Gowns Replacer' by Korana.

MCA - Westly's FCOT Addon.esp

Adds the clothing from Westly's 'Fine Clothiers of Tamriel' to the MCA NPCs. Make
sure it loads after the 'Khajiit Diversity Revamped' and 'Clothiers of Vvardenfell'
add-ons if you are using those. Requires 'Fine Clothiers of Tamriel'.

MCA - BadKarma Clothing Vendor Addon.esp *New*

Adds the clothing from BadKarma's 'BadKarma Clothing Vendor' to the MCA NPCs.
Requires 'BadKarma Clothing Vendor' by BadKarma.

MCA - Hilgya the Seamstress Addon.esp *New*

Adds the clothing from Plangkye's 'Hilgya the Seamstress' to the MCA NPCs. Requires
Hilgya the Seamstress + Expansion 1 by Plangkye.


Note that any addon esps from older versions of Morrowind Comes Alive will NOT work
with this one, so you can delete those. These addons (Bandits, Wilderness NPCs and
the Guards Patch) have now been put into the main .esm, making them redundant. The
old Necessities of Morrowind compatibility patch is also redundant as MCA and NOM
no longer conflict. Any third party addons will also probably not work with this
version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDED MODS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is highly recommended that you use the following mods alongside MCA to enhance
your Morrowind experience:

'Westly Presents: Fine Clothiers of Tamriel' by Westly @
http://download.fliggerty.com/download-127-751
Adds some amazing new clothing, which the MCA NPCs will wear if you use the add-on.

'Ranked Dremora' by Neoptolemus @ http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42117
Separates all Dremora into ranks like in Oblivion. All have unique meshes, using
Miltiades' Dremora race as a base, and has an option to add female Dremora as well.

'Ships of the Imperial Navy' by Neoptolemus @
http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42103
Adds some cool looking galleons to various locations around Vvardenfell. Includes an
add-on for 'Tamriel Rebuilt'.

'Tamriel Rebuilt' @ http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145/
I don't think I need to explain this one.
 
'The Undead' by Neoptolemus @ http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43030
Basically Morrowind Comes Alive for undead. This was formerly part of MCA, but has
been moved to a fully compatible stand-alone mod.

'Westly's Pluginless Head Replacer' by Westly @ http://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/westlys-pluginless-head-replacer
Replaces all the ugly Bethesda heads.

'Wyrmhaven' by Neoptolemus @ http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42933
Has absolutely nothing to do with MCA, but it's a cool island/quest mod that I
made and you should totally play it.

you to use in your own mods as long as you credit the original authors. The only
