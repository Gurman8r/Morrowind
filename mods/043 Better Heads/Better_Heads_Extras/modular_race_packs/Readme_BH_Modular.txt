Better Heads Modular
*************************

This archive consists of esps that will allow you to replace specific races and genders with the faces and hair from Better Heads without having to replace all races. What this means is if you like one race or gender but not another, you can now just pick the ones you want. Note that this archive does not include any meshes or textures, it is just esm files. You will still need the main Better Heads file which you can get with a size of 8.55 MB and an installer program at 
the following sites:

http://fantasyfreak.netfirms.com/
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/hofferc/bh_v1_install_rc1.zip

or as rar archive without the installer at the following sites:

http://tfo.rh.rit.edu/esforum/BH/Better_Heads_v1.rar
http://www.dragonsight.com

Each race and gender has its own file for a replace.
Individual replacements are available in seperate files for Helseth and Barenziah. Tribunal is required, but no other mod is required so you can use those two files with or without any other Better Heads files or any other mods.
The following races and genders also have a Bloodmoon addon that will correct any mismatches of heads and hair in Solstheim and  you should use if you use these as well for whatever races you choose if you have Bloodmoon:

Breton males
Dark Elf males
Imperial males
Imperial females
Nord males *				
Nord females *

* Note that on the Nords if you use the Bloodmoon addons it will also replace the new Bethesda heads that came with Bloodmoon so if you want the regular MW Nords replaced but not the Bloodmoon Nords then do not use the Nord Bloodmoon addons.

There are also esps in the extras directory. You can use them to edit some of the selections and further modify the esps to your taste, but to minimize conflicts, if you modify an esp, you should convert it to esm which can be done with Argent's tool TESDTK at http://members.optusnet.com.au/argent2/tool_description.htm#TESDTK

For any problems or questions please post at the Official Elder Scrolls forum at http://www.elderscrolls.com/ubbthreads/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=UBB7 and I or someone else will assist you.

Thanks and enjoy!
