N'Dib's Twilight Resources 0.5

*--------------------*
*    What is it?     *
*--------------------*
This contains all the resources (Models, items, textures, and icons) used in an unreleased and unfinished mod called N'Dib's Twilight.  The mod will most likely not be finished, at least not by me, and so I've decided to release all these resources rather than let them go to waste.  Use them how you like as long as you follow the Creative Commons license at the end of this document.Read it carefully and make *sure* you understand before you use this.

If you'd like *specific* 3ds max or photoshop files used for any of the models/textures, contact me, and I may be able to provide them.

Contents: ~550 new models/textures/icons including: New (tree)house interiors, exteriors and accessories, ship interiors, exteriors and accessories, a new dungeon tileset, new heads and hairstyles for 3 different races, numerous new plants and ingredients, new trees, tileable cliffsets and other landscape pieces, and a ton of odds and ends.

*--------------------*
*    Installation    *
*--------------------*
Extract the zip archive to your Morrowind\Data Files directory. If you've installed earlier versions of these models, delete them first, or overwrite them with the new ones when asked.  The readme and .esp file should end up in the main Data Files directory.  Nif files should end up in the Data Files\Meshes directory.  Dds files should end up in the Data Files\Textures directory.
