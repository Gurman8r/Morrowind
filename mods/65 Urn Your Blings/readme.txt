                                   DESCRIPTION

             All those boring urns in ancestral tombs that normally
             only have Bonemeal in them now occasionally yield some
             leveled loot. Most commonly, Gravedust, but sometimes
             a nice little enchanted trinket or gem.

             Inspired by Loot Well Urned, but a lot more balanced.


                                   REQUIREMENTS

             Requires Tribunal and Bloodmoon.


                                  COMPATIBILITY

             This mod changes one container, the urns in tombs. It is
             compatible with any mod that doesn't also do that, most
             notably Loot Well Urned.


                                  KNOWN ISSUES

             None that I've found in testing. Please let me know if
             you find any issues.


                                   PERMISSIONS

             Anyone may freely modify, distribute, or rehost this mod
             as long as they include this readme and attribute credit
             to me, Seibaby, as the original author, and provided any
             modified work is published under its own name.


                                    CONTACT

             If you have questions, feedback, or bug reports, you may
             send me a message via Nexus, or find me in the Morrowind
             modding Discord.
