Better Robes 0.3.1

Author: Moranar, the base meshes of robes was taken from NioLiv's Clothing mesh collection for Better Bodies and Male Coat Add-On.

Requirements: Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoonn and Better Bodies 2.2 or later.

This plugin replaces meshes of Morrowind robes with more highpoly meshes. All changed robes have female version of mesh.

Installation:
Copy "Data Files" folder to the root game directory and merge folders, if you want to see in game female versions of robes enable Better Robes.esp 
If you use Tamriel Rebuilt Map 3 - Sacred East 1.5, there is patch for this plugin.
You may use my mod with Unique Finery Replacer, if you install patch for it. This patch also adopts shoes from UFR to Better bodies and requires Better Clothes too.

Conflicts:
This mod conflicts with any other replacer of robe's meshes. If you want to use it with Ice NioLiv Robe Replacer or CanadianIce Robe Replacer just don't activate esp in launcher.

Permission:
All meshes and esp-files from the mod can be used anywhere without asking, but you must remember that it is only a beta-version.
