nexusDescription="[size=5][b]Description[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]Simple Camping is a camping mod that is made for people who are looking for a simple and easy to use mod that allows for sleeping and role-playing. It is lore-friendly and does not impact the gameplay that much, so it's perfect for people looking to have a camp without fancy gameplay changes. Unlike some other mods, it does not just use an item, so you will not see any unimmersive prices of the bedrolls or duration of the campfires pop-up on the screen.\n<br />\n<br />To use this mod you need to have Tribunal and Bloodmoon (which I'm sure everyone has in 2022! :P).\n<br />This mod also works with OpenMW and the vanilla game. MWSE is not required to use this mod\n<br />\n<br />This mod currently includes:\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]A bedroll[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]A toggle-able campfire[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]How to Install[/size][/b][size=3]\n<br />With a mod loader (recommended):[/size][size=3]Just click the mod loader button or manually download it and drag the 7z into the mod loader of your choice, such as Vortex, Mod Organizer 2, or Wrye Mash.\n<br />\n<br />Manually:\n<br />Unzip the 7z with the 7zip application into your Morrowind install folder.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]More Info[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=3]This is the first mod I have released publicly. If you have found a bug, please let me know so I can fix it!\n<br />In addition, if you have any recommendations of what I should add or change in my mod, make sure to go to the forum tab and make a suggestion on the stickied suggestion post.\n<br />I could end up adding more content in the long run.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Thank you!
