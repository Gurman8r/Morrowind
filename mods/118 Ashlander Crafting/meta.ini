Either load this mod after the other mods that do this, or merge leveled lists (as with Wrye Mash).\n<br />\n<br />[b]==========\n<br />Description\n<br />==========[/b]\n<br />This mod allows you to prepare materials and craft several different kinds of weapons and armor appropriate for an Ashlander. A full list is below.\n<br />\n<br />With this mod, you can take a hide from a creature, place it on your portable tanning rack and cure it with salt. Make simple armor with it. Or grind roots or leaves into tannin to tan the cured hide on the rack to make it better. Or harden the leather with resin to make it stronger still. Loot chitin fragments (new with this mod) from shalks and kwama workers and warriors. Use your crafting tool to make chitin armor and weapons. Or if you're really good, craft \"dark chitin\" armor. The better your Armorer skill, the better chance you'll have to craft the materials and armor, and the better quality your crafted weapons and repair tools will be. Yes, you can craft repair tools.\n<br />\n<br />You'll need the following.\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Crafting Tool.\n<br />[*]Tanner's Knife.\n<br />[*]Tannin Grinder.\n<br />[*]Tanning Rack. It's portable! Equip it onto your character to set it up.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />To get the tools you need, visit one of the following traders.\n<br />\n<br />Bervyn Lleryn, Vivec St. Olms Waistworks\n<br />Ababael Timsar-Dadisun, Zainab Camp\n<br />Kurapli, Urshilaku Camp\n<br />Massarapal, Erabenimsun Camp\n<br />Lanabi, Ahemmusa Camp\n<br />\n<br />For a helpful guide on the process, visit Jobasha's Rare Books and get yourself a copy of [b]Ashlander Crafting Tradition[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mod features and details\n<br />-----------------------------[/b]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]The ability to craft many types of crafting materials, armor, and weapons from raw materials you find while hunting and gathering. A full list is below.\n<br />[*]This mod uses the same mechanics to determine your ability to craft these items as the base game uses to determine your ability to repair weapons and armor. Your Armorer skill is most important.\n<br />[*]Some armor and other items are visually unique to this mod.\n<br />[*]These items are all balanced. No god items.\n<br />[*]Most items have a larger-than-typical enchanting potential.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]What can I craft?[/b]\n<br />[b]--------------------[/b]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Cured Hide.\n<br />[*]Tanned Leather.\n<br />[*]Hardened Leather.\n<br />[*]Vegetable Tannin.\n<br />[*]Hide Jerkin.
