Ashlander Crafting v1.0
by Ian
===============================


============
Requirements
============
This mod requires the latest versions of Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon.


========
Conflicts
========
This mod will have a minor conflict with anything that adds or changes loot from shalks, kwama creatures, and mudcrabs. Either load this mod after the other mods that do this, or merge leveled lists (as with Wrye Mash).


==========
Description
==========
This mod allows you to prepare materials and craft several different kinds of weapons and armor appropriate for an Ashlander. A full list is below.

With this mod, you can take a hide from a creature, place in on your portable tanning rack and cure it with salt. Make simple armor with it. Or grind roots or leaves into tannin to tan the cured hide on the rack to make it better. Or harden the leather with resin to make it stronger still. Loot chitin fragments (new with this mod) from shalk, kwama creatures and mudcrabs. Use your crafting tool to make chitin armor and weapons. Or if you're really good, craft "dark chitin" armor. The better your Armorer skill, the better chance you'll have to craft the materials and armor, and the better quality your crafted weapons and repair tools will be. Yes, you can craft repair tools.

You'll need the following.

1. Crafting Tool.
2. Tanner's Knife.
3. Tannin Grinder.
4. Tanning Rack. It's portable! Equip it onto your character to set it up.
